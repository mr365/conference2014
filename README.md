==============
The wesite is hoster on the free cloudspace provided by heroku.com
Using Bootstrapclasses has made the website site simply compact and lite. 
I have explored most of the bootsrap componenets and have implemented them in this website, so this website can be
a very good source of reference to beginners on bootsrap.
I used codeKit on my Mac to compress and minify my javascript and css files.
"Happy browsing!"
