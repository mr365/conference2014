		<p>Hotel founder, Henry Chasings, had a love of otters, having been raised in an Alaskan village where otters played out his back door. As his tribute to the sea creatures of his early days, Henry was insistent upon having an otter in every hall, wall, and room inside the Otter Renaissance Hotel.</p>
